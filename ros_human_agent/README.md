# ros-human-agent

This agent is the ROS version of the [human agent](https://github.com/carla-simulator/leaderboard/blob/master/leaderboard/autoagents/human_agent.py) already available at the main leaderboard repository. As its predecessor, the ROS human agent gives the user complete control of the ego vehicle, allowing you, among others, to debug any behavior inside the leaderboard without the need of complex calculus inside the agent.

This agent uses the following submodules:
- **Scenario Runner**
- **Leaderboard**
- **Ros Bridge**
