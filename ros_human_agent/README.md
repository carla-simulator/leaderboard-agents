# Ros Human agent

This agent is intended to emulate the [human agent](https://github.com/carla-simulator/leaderboard/blob/master/leaderboard/autoagents/human_agent.py), which is  already available at the main Leaderboard repository, but created using ROS. As its predecessor, the ROS human agent gives the user complete control of the ego vehicle, allowing you, among others, to debug any behavior inside the Leaderboard without the need of complex calculus inside the agent. Lastly, while this agent can be submitted to the Leaderboard it will obviously not move.
